# Newtonian Gravitation Collision Time
The Python script simulates a scenario where two objects with masses `m_1` and `m_2` starting with zero velocity gravitate towards eachother in empty space until their centers of gravity are a distance `r_f`, which is the sum of their radii, apart. The time it takes to collide in the simulation is then printed out to verify against an equation derivation, which is described in more detail in `paper/*` or at https://www.onemoreangle.com/article/gravitation-collision-time-derivation

Output of the simulation with a `dt` of `0.001`:
```
dt: 0.001000
simulation time: 5521437.476000
equation time: 5521437.475077
kepler time: 5522200.716264
