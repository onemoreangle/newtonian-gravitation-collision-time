# Newtonian Gravitational Collision Time

Output of the simulation with a `dt of 0.001`:
```
With a dt of 0.001000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776702880859375 our simulation time in seconds is
5521437.476000000115752156694
According to our full final equation, the following should be the time in seconds:
5521437.4750773385
And according to the Kepler equation, we get:
5522200.716263853
